* `example_commands.txt`: example commands for jittering one chain in a protein-protein interface relative to another, scoring jitters with the "beta_soft" energy function, and input arguments for relaxing structures using Rosetta@Home
* `jitter_binder.py`: Python script for jittering
* `relax_interface_of_chainA.xml`, `relax_interface_of_chainB.xml`, and `relax_interface_of_complex.xml`: RosettaScripts XML files defining the protocol for using FastRelax to relax interface residues of input structures, with one script each for: relaxing both protein chains from the interface, relaxing only chain A (after deleting chain B) or relaxing only chain B (after deleting chain A). We use these XMLs as input files for performing the relax protocols using Rosetta@Home, as described in the `example_commands.txt` file.
