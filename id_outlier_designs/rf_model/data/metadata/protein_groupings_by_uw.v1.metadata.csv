# Updated Hugh's groupings with the NTF2 topology
# Summary of criteria for being in a group (for this iteration of groupings):
#    - All designs have the same topology
#    - All designs were made using a similar protocol at the same point in time
#    - One exception: HHH from the Inna library grouped with HHH from the Eva libraries. Even though they were made at
#                     different times, Hughâ€™s understanding is that they are very closely related in terms of how they
#                     were made.
#    - Sequence length can vary, though Hugh thought it was a good idea to use length as a criterion in the future.
