* `unmod/`: pairs of original design models and crystal structures with a single copy of the design and just the design chain(s) (see the `README.md` file for details).
* `mod/`: pairs of design models and crystal structures modified to have the exact same sequence. See the `README.md` file in the subdirectory for more details. 
* `relax_and_scoring_protocols/`: protocols for using Rosetta to relax and score structures with a given energy function. This directory also contains all output PDBs from relaxing the modified structures from above, energies of the relaxed structuresk, and plots showing the energies and RMSD values of relaxed structures.
