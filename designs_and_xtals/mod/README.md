These PDBs come from the ones in the `unmod/` subdirectory, but have been modified so that each design and crystal pair has the exact same sequence.
For some pairs, this involved removing a few residues (mostly at the termini or unresolved loops) that were present in either one structure or another due to residues not being resolved in the crystal, or the crystal having nondesigned residues at a terminus.
For the following two pairs, the crystal structure had a few mutations relative to the design model, all at solvent-exposed sites on the surface of the structure. I mutated these positions in the design model to match the crystal:
* WSHC6: K20Y, K89Y, K158Y, K227Y, K296Y, R354K, K365Y
* 5L6HC3_1: K74Y, K151Y, K230Y
